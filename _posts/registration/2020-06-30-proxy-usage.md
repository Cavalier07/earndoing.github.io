# Can I use a proxy server or VPN?

No, the use of proxy servers or VPN's is against our terms of service. This is to protect our partners from fraudulent completions of surveys and offers on Earn Doing.

We currently use [IP Quality Score](https://www.ipqualityscore.com/) to check if you are using a proxy/VPN.
